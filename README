Vizigrep
========
Graphical file contents search tool using regular expressions.

Vizigrep is a graphical user interface for performing fast and powerful searches
inside a group of files.  Simply tell Vizigrep which folder you want to search
and what you want to search for and it will quickly find all occurrences of your
search string within the files and folders you have selected.  The search
results are annotated to show you the lines containing your search term and
color coding is used to help you quickly lock your eyes on to what you are
searching for. If simple search strings are not powerful enough Vizigrep also
understands regular expressions.
