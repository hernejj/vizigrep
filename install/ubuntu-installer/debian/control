Description: Graphical file contents search tool using regular expressions
 Vizigrep is a graphical user interface for performing fast and powerful
 searches inside a group of files.  Simply tell Vizigrep which folder you want
 to search and what you want to search for and it will quickly find all
 occurrences of your search string within the files and folders you have
 selected.  The search results are annotated to show you the lines containing
 your search term and color coding is used to help you quickly lock your eyes on
 to what you are searching for. If simple search strings are not powerful enough
 Vizigrep also understands regular expressions.
